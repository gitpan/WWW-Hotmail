      I am writing today to tell you about something important.

      Thanks for all your support.
  
      Sincerely,
      Other Person
      ]) or die $WWW::Hotmail::errstr;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a partial replacement for the "gotmail" script
    (http://ssl.usu.edu/paul/gotmail/), so if this doesn't do what you want,
    try that instead.

    Create a new "WWW::Hotmail" object with "new", and then log in with your
    MSN username and password with the "login" method.

METHODS
  login
    Make sure to add the domain to your username, for example
    foo@hotmail.com. Then this will allow you to use the "messages" method
    to look at the mail in your inbox. The login method does not retrieve
    messages on login. The messages method does that now.

  messages
    This method returns a list of "WWW::Hotmail::Message"s; each message
    supports four methods: "subject" gives you the subject of the email,
    just because it was stunningly easy to implement. "retrieve" retrieves
    an email into a "Mail::Audit" object - see Mail::Audit for more details.
    "from" gives you the from field. Finally "delete" moves it to your
    trash.

  compose
    You can use the "compose" message to send a message through the account
    you are currently logged in to. You should be able to use this method as
    many times and as often as you like during the life of the
    "WWW::Hotmail" object. As its argument, it takes a hash whose keys are
    "to", "cc", "bcc", "subject", "body". Newlines should work fine in the
    "body" argument. Any field can be an array; it will be joined with a
    comma. This function returns 1 on success and undef on failure. Check
    $WWW::Hotmail::errstr for errors, or use $WWW::Hotmail::errhtml for an
    html version of the error.

NOTES
    This module used to croak errors for you. If you would like this
    behavior, then add $WWW::Hotmail::croak_on_error = 1; to your script. It
    will not croak html.

    This module should work with email addresses at charter.com, compaq.net,
    hotmail.com, msn.com, passport.com, and webtv.net

    This module is reasonably fragile. It seems to work, but I haven't
    tested edge cases. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces. I hope to
    improve it in the future, but this is enough for release.
