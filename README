NAME
    WWW::Hotmail - Connect to Hotmail and download messages

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::Hotmail;
      my $browser = new WWW::Hotmail;
      $browser->login("foo", "bar");
      for ($browser->messages) { $_->retrieve->accept; $_->delete; }

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a partial replacement for the "gotmail" script
    (http://ssl.usu.edu/paul/gotmail/), so if this doesn't do what you want,
    try that instead.

    Create a new "WWW::Hotmail" object with "new", and then log in with your
    Hotmail username and password. This will allow you to use the "messages"
    method to look at the mail in your inbox.

    This method returns a list of "WWW::Hotmail::Message"s; each message
    supports three methods: "subject" gives you the subject of the email,
    just because it was stunningly easy to implement. "retrieve" turns the
    email into a "Mail::Audit" object - see Mail::Audit for more details.
    Finally "delete" moves it to your trash.

    That's it. I said it was partial.

SEE ALSO
    WWW::Mechanize, Mail::Audit, "gotmail"

NOTE
    This module is reasonable fragile. It seems to work, but I haven't
    tested edge cases. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces. I hope to
    improve it in the future, but this is enough for release.
